                    <p>I had the opportunity to work at Kodum for four months during a summer in 2022, where I gained valuable experiences in various areas.
                         My main work was in JUnit testing and backend coding with Java 8 and I also explored XML and XSLT and combined it with Java.
                         This hands-on experience provided me with valuable insights into the IT industry, and it was truly exciting.</p>

                    <p>
                        I am majoring in software engineering and I am currently writing my bachelors thesis about gamification in todays software.
                        I have a minor in electrical engineering and I have really enjoyed tinkering with arduino since it is a little bit from both worlds.
                        I have been enjoying most of my studies but a few subjects stand out, which are algorithms, which made me challenge myself,
                        sql because it was so different from all the other languages I have used so far,
                        UI, UX because I found it nice to think about different ways to do things, and
                        my native language, because it showed me that speaking in front of a bunch of people isn't that scary after all.

                    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                    <h6>Creativity and movement</h6>
                    <p>
                        I like to take great care of my physical well-being by skateboarding during the summers, playing games, like badminton or basketball with my friends and going to the gym regularly. 
                        It's important for me to keep my body active and prevent it from feeling stagnant after spending long hours in front of a computer. 
                        While I find solace in working outdoors, I also appreciate the opportunity to unwind indoors.
                        During my leisure time, I find joy in playing various instruments like the keyboard, guitar and harmonica. 
                        Additionally, I have a keen interest in drawing, writing and cooking which I find to be a good creative and tasty outlet. 
                        Another way I relax and have fun is by playing video games and board games alone or with friends.
                        These activities not only provide me with physical and creative outlets but also offer opportunities for personal growth, self-expression, and enjoyment.

                    <h3>Future plans</h3>
                    <h6>My plans</h6>
                    <p>
                        I love games and I aspire to fulfill my dream of publishing at least one game in my lifetime.
                        It's an endeavor that ignites my creativity and fuels my determination.
                        Beyond game development, my career goals encompass finding a company that offers not only a positive work environment but also meaningful and fulfilling tasks.
                        I aspire to work alongside people who share a common vision and values, cultivating a sense of belonging. 
                        Building genuine friendships with my colleagues is important to me as it creates a supportive and enjoyable work atmosphere.
                        In my pursuit of personal and professional growth, I constantly seek out challenges and opportunities to expand my horizons.
                        Embracing new experiences is a priority as I believe it to take me further than getting used to the same old.
                        By combining my love for games, a fulfilling work environment, meaningful relationships,
                        and a willingness to venture into uncharted territories, I strive to make my dreams a reality and create a fulfilling and exciting future.
