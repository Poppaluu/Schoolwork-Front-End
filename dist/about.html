                    <h6>keeping myself in condition</h6>
                    <p>I like to workout, keep myself in a good enough condition that my body feels like it has moved and not just sat around the computer all day. I enjoy working outside but love to blow off steam inside. I skateboard sometimes, mostly during the summer. I have a harmonica and play it when I have time to do so and I feel inspired or melancholy. I also like to draw and play video games.</p>
